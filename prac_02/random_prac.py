# Line 1: Smallest number: 5 Largest number:20
# Line 2: Smallest number: 3 Largest number:9. No you wouldn't be able to see a 4 due to the smallest number if it
# increases by the two steps the result would be 5.
# Line 3: Smallest number: will approach 2.5 but never equal exactly 2.5 and Largest number 5.5
